Hello, today we're going to be looking at the state of the web, some of it's pitfalls and how Dat improves upon it with the peer to peer web.

## ðŸ¤” How does the web work? ðŸ¤”

???

Before we get into Dat, lets quickly look at how the web works

---

class: center, middle

![HTML, JavaScript and CSS form a webpage](assets/webpages.mermaid.svg)

???

The core part of the web is web pages.

They consist of some HTML for the structure and text content, some CSS for styling the display of the page, and JavaScript for interactivity.

![Users connect to servers](assets/servers.mermaid.svg)

???

These files are typically stored or generated on the fly by web servers.

---

![Publisher connects to server, reader reads from server](assets/publishing.mermaid.svg)

???

Publishers connect to servers and store their contents on them, readers will them connect to these servers to read the data

# ðŸ˜Ž Great! ðŸ˜Ž

???

So this sounds all cool, right?

---

# ðŸ¤” Unless? ðŸ¤”

???

Well, there's just one problem to consider

---

class: center, middle

![When you can't reach the server everyone is sad](assets/outage.mermaid.svg)

???

Sadly, this system is fragile. There's a lot of things that can go wrong in ways that totally destroy the system.

You might just not have an internet connections at the moment.

Your government might be censoring a particular bit of information.

You might not have money to either host the data, or to have an internet connection to load the data.

Lastly, the server can go down for any number of reasons and break everything.

# ðŸŒŸâœ¨P2Pâœ¨ðŸŒŸ

???

P2P provides another story for how this can all work

---

class: center, middle

![User publishes to other user](assets/p2p.mermaid.svg)

???

Someobdy can create some content, and then transfer it directly to whoever wants it over the P2P network

This is more resiliant since

![Data propogating through network](assets/p2p-down.mermaid.svg)

???

The p2p network is more resiliant to outages since you can load data from other peers

---

![Dat logo](assets/dat-logo.png)

???

This is what Dat enables. It lets you transport data over a p2p network without tying you to a specific server.

- Create folder
- Make index.html

## ðŸ§  How does it work? ðŸ§ 

???

Lets look at some of the interneals

## Peer Discovery

![Connect between peers through DHT](assets/swarm.mermaid.svg)

???

Dat uses a Distributed Hash Table for discovering IP addresses for peers trying to share a Dat Archive.

A DHT is like a key value store where every peer in the network stores a little bit of the data.

An algorithm called Kademlia is used to determine which peers store which data and makes it efficient to do lookups as the network size grows.

When a peer wants to share an archive, it publishes it's IP address on the DHT as a value for a key that's detived from the Dat URL.

The key is derived using a hashing function so that the actual URL isn't being shared anywhere.

This is done because the URL is used as an encryption key between two peers which prevents node that don't have it from being able to access the data.

When a node boots up and wants to discover peers, it will query the DHT for the discovery key and will get a list of IP addresses.

Then it will attempt to establish connections to peers and start replicating data.

## Append-Only Logs

![Log items linking together](assets/logs.mermaid.svg)

Once we have connected to a peer we start exchanging data for append only logs.

An append only log is a data structure that's kind of like a linked list, or an oplog, or a blockchain.

You have a history of items, and each new item links to the previous one.

Dat overlays a data structure called a Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) wich lets you download a subset of the log and still be able to verify it's integrity.

Part of the way it does this is that the latest "head" of the merkle DAG is signed by the private key of the archive.

The public key (used in the Dat URL) is then used to verify that the DAG is valid.

Dat's replication protocol has a way to efficiently compare which subsets of the logs two peers have and enables peers to request ranges of the others' logs to be sent over the connection.

## Filesystem Abstraction

![Load to content feed then metadata feed](assets/fs.mermaid.svg)

Dat builds its filesystem abstraction on top of two append only logs.

One of the logs is used to store the raw content of files, and the other is used to store metadata about the folder structure.

When a user adds a file to an archive, they first load the file contents into the content feed.

Then, they take the start and end index of the file in the feed, and append an item to the metadata feed pointing the file at those indexes.

When a peer wants to load a file, they'll search for it's path in the metadata feed, then request to download the range from the content feed.

What's interesting is that Dat can stream the data for the file and stream it's data to the application as it's being loaded from peers.

At the applicaiton level, you can interact with Dat the way you would any regular filesystem and it will handle all the loading under the hood.

## ðŸ”§ [SDK](https://github.com/datproject/sdk) ðŸ”§

???

All of this stuff is abstracted away by the Dat SDK which enables you to build apps using JavaScript in Node.js and the Browser.

It figures out getting networking to work in both Node and the Browser (using WebRTC and a Proxy), picks sane defaults for where to store your files, and wires everything together to improve network efficiency.

This is the place to go if you want to get started with building applications with Dat.
